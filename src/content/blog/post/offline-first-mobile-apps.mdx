description: Discover best practices for building mobile apps that remain functional without a network connection through caching, feature prioritization and conflict resolution.

When I deployed my first mobile application, early user feedback was humbling: in regions with spotty connectivity the app felt broken. Clicking a button would spin indefinitely or throw an error. That experience led me to the concept of **offline‑first** design. The premise is simple yet powerful—assume no network connection, and architect your app to store and synchronize data locally.

## Cache early, cache often

The first pillar of offline‑first is caching. When connectivity is available, your app should opportunistically fetch and persist data so that it remains accessible later. On native mobile platforms this means writing to SQLite via libraries like Room on Android or Core Data on iOS. In React Native you might use `AsyncStorage` or libraries such as `react-native-mmkv`:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

async function saveArticles(articles) {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('cachedArticles', JSON.stringify(articles));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to save articles', e);
  }
}

async function getCachedArticles() {
  const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('cachedArticles');
  return value ? JSON.parse(value) : [];
}
```

On the web, service workers and IndexedDB provide similar capabilities. By loading data from the cache first and syncing in the background, your app starts instantly and continues to work offline.

## Identify non‑negotiable features

Not everything can work without connectivity. Real‑time payments, live location tracking or push notifications inherently rely on a network. Identify which features absolutely require a connection and build graceful fallback states. For example, a ride‑hailing app might let users view their ride history offline but disable booking new rides until connectivity is restored. Clear messaging such as banners or modals helps set expectations.

## Be ready for conflict

Allowing users to edit data offline introduces the challenge of reconciling changes once the network is back. Should the server version always override local edits, or should the latest timestamp win? In a note‑taking app I built, we implemented optimistic updates and a simple “last write wins” strategy to merge text changes. For more complex data like collaborative documents, you might offer users a conflict resolution UI or employ Operational Transform or CRDT algorithms. Planning for reconciliation up front prevents unpleasant surprises later.

## Tools and techniques

Modern frameworks provide building blocks for offline‑first. Native apps can leverage background synchronization APIs to upload pending changes in the background, and the Network Information API on the web allows you to tailor behavior based on connection type. Libraries like PouchDB can sync local IndexedDB databases with a CouchDB server when a connection is available. Regardless of the stack, ensure that your app gracefully handles retries and exponential backoff.

Embracing an offline‑first mindset forces you to think about real‑world conditions: spotty Wi‑Fi, airplane mode, or deep subway tunnels. By designing for resilience from the start, you deliver an experience that delights users even when networks fail. It’s an investment that pays off in reliability, user satisfaction and ultimately retention.
