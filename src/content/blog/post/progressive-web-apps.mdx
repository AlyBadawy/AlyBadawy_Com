Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) blur the line between websites and native applications. They leverage standard web technologies to deliver experiences that are fast, reliable and engaging. The first time I built a PWA for a side project, I was impressed that users could install it to their home screen and continue using it even when they lost connectivity.

A PWA is a web application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that behaves like a native app. It combines the ubiquity of the web with the capabilities of native platforms: users can install it on a device, work offline, receive push notifications and integrate with system features. Because PWAs run in the browser, you maintain a single codebase while still delivering an app‑like experience.

Several characteristics make PWAs stand out. First, installability: users can add the app to their home screen without going through an app store. Second, offline functionality: service workers intercept network requests and provide cached responses so the app continues to work on flaky connections. Third, progressive enhancement: the app works on any browser but unlocks more features on modern browsers. Finally, PWAs can run full screen, send push notifications and access device capabilities such as the camera and location (with permission), making them feel native.

To convert a web app into a PWA you need three things. A secure HTTPS connection is required for service workers and push notifications. A **Web App Manifest** describes the app’s name, icons and theme colors; browsers use this file to install the app and display its icons. And a **service worker** acts as a proxy between your app and the network, caching assets and handling background tasks. Libraries like Workbox simplify service worker creation, and frameworks such as Next.js and Vue offer PWA plugins that handle much of the configuration.

Here’s a minimal example of registering a service worker in JavaScript:

```js showLineNumbers
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register("/service-worker.js")
      .then((registration) => {
        console.log(
          "ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ",
          registration.scope
        );
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("ServiceWorker registration failed: ", error);
      });
  });
}
```

The `service-worker.js` file can cache assets, handle fetch requests and manage updates. Using Workbox, you can define caching strategies like `staleWhileRevalidate` or `cacheFirst` without writing boilerplate.

PWAs are ideal for content‑heavy sites, e‑commerce stores and SaaS applications where improved performance and offline support enhance user experience. They reduce friction by eliminating app store downloads and enable re‑engagement through push notifications. In my own projects, adding a PWA layer increased user retention because the app loaded quickly even when offline.

By combining the reach of the web with the capabilities of native apps, PWAs offer a compelling option for delivering modern web experiences. If you’re looking to broaden your audience and provide a resilient, installable app without building separate native versions, a PWA might be the perfect fit.
