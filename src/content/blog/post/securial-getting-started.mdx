---

Securial is a mountable Rails engine that delivers a flexible authentication and access control system for Rails applications. I created this gem after repeatedly building similar login and authorization features across multiple projects. Instead of copying code from project to project, I decided to package everything into a reusable engine that supports JWT‑based authentication, API session tokens and traditional session cookies. Whether you’re building a single‑page web app or a native mobile client, Securial’s API‑first design provides clean JSON responses out of the box.

## Why Securial?

Traditional authentication libraries lock you into a particular database or force you to conform to their conventions. Securial follows Rails conventions but remains modular and extensible. It ships with separate modules for authentication, user management, generators and configuration, allowing you to swap out pieces without touching the core. The engine is database‑agnostic—you can use PostgreSQL, MySQL or even a document store. In many of my client projects, this flexibility has meant less time wrestling with an inflexible library and more time focusing on business logic.

Because Securial returns JSON by default, it’s perfect for applications that consume your API from JavaScript frameworks or mobile apps. You don’t need to customize responses or strip out view helpers; the gem is built with API clients in mind.

## Installation

Adding Securial to an existing Rails app is straightforward. First include the gem in your `Gemfile` and install it:

```ruby showLineNumbers
# Gemfile
gem 'securial'
```

Then run the bundler to download and install the gem:

```bash showLineNumbers
bundle install
```

Next generate Securial’s configuration files, models and migrations:

```bash showLineNumbers
rails generate securial:install
```

This command creates an initializer (`config/initializers/securial.rb`) where you can tweak settings, as well as migration files for creating the necessary tables. Once the files are in place, mount the engine in your routes file to expose the API endpoints:

```ruby showLineNumbers
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Securial::Engine => '/securial'
  # other routes go here
end
```

Finally, run the migrations to set up the database tables:

```bash showLineNumbers
rails db:migrate
```

If you’d rather start fresh, Securial includes a command to scaffold an entire Rails application with everything preconfigured:

```bash showLineNumbers
securial new my_app
cd my_app
rails server
```

This will give you a running Rails API complete with authentication endpoints. From there, you can begin integrating the gem into your front‑end by hitting the `/securial/sessions` and `/securial/accounts` endpoints with your client.

Once Securial is installed, you’re ready to configure authentication flows and tailor it to your needs. The next step is to explore the initializer, define your user model fields and adjust token lifetimes. The gem’s modular design means you can override controllers, customize JSON responses or hook in multi‑factor authentication without forking the codebase. Securial grew out of my desire for a reusable, flexible authentication engine, and I hope it streamlines your Rails projects as much as it has mine.
